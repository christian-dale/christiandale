**Could Universal Basic Income be the solution to a failing welfare system?**

In this article, I will lay out the pros of UBI and how it might solve many of the issues current welfare systems are experiencing. So join me on my journey of discovering a better world for all. From now on, I will refer to Universal Basic Income as UBI.

### Issues with current welfare systems

The issues related to the current welfare systems are multifaceted, although some problems are more pressing than others. The first big issue is its fundamental historic design flaws. Welfare as a system had the following original aims:

* Give an income to individuals incapable of working because of evident and diagnosable sicknesses.
* Rehabilitating the induvidual with the hopes of being employed again in the future.

The welfare system emerged at a time when societies as a whole were facing different issues than what they currently are doing. The family dynamic was completely different; people lived in a traditional family structure. The husband went to work, while the wife was homebound and focused on caring for their children. The majority of people had stable jobs where they worked 8 hours workdays. They earned a livable wage that could support their family, and they usually kept this job until retirement.

That's no longer the case to the same extent; many do not live in this traditional family structure, and society must adapt in some ways to accommodate the structural changes. The job market has changed completely. People are more adaptable and usually change career paths or jobs throughout life. A growing group in society is working from home or doing freelance work. These jobs have an unstable income but are increasingly becoming ideal for many.

### Complexities

Sickness is not always easy to define. Many people struggle with health issues that do not always fit a specific diagnosis. Humans are much too complex to be put into a category, and reasons, why one might not work, are multifaceted.

A common misconception is that unemployed people are not contributing to society. The current definition of work is too limited, and we all need to broaden our perspectives. Work - in the traditional sense - generates value in the form of wealth. The reality is that most people create some form of value for society.

Some examples of value generated that does not fit the traditional description of work are the following:

* Voluntary work
* Art and creative work, in its many forms
* Social support through friendships and other generally positive relationships

Many unemployed people can do these untraditional jobs. They feel they aren't receiving any reward or recognition from society for this. An unfortunate reality as it causes a range of issues for an individual. Not the mention the uncertainty faced when you know that your welfare payouts might stop altogether.

Another issue faced is the social stigma of being a welfare recipient - this increases inequality in society - which results in discrimination based on life situations and income.

### Defining what UBI is

UBI is a universal government-funded payout for every citizen over a specified age. Although some people disagree on the implementation details of UBI, the payout should be wholly unconditional.
People somewhat disagree on the technicalities of how UBI should be implemented, but the idea at its core is whatÂ´s important.

### Tax system

The goal is to give everyone a livable wage, which means people who earn above the median yearly income would have to pay the dividend back as taxes. A core principle of UBI is the unconditionality. People receive an income regardless of income level.

### How it solves the current issues with welfare

As mentioned earlier, it is a common misconception that people who receive "free" money will remain inactive - be "slobs" watching tv all day. That's false, and the research shows that most people would do the opposite. Most people want to work if able. Most individuals wish to contribute or help in some way.

You have probably heard the trope: Giving positive reinforcements has much better results than negative reinforcements. I believe the same reasoning fits most areas of society, especially welfare.

### What about people who require additional support?

Expenses differ based on the individual. Examples are people with children or people with considerable medical expenses.

### Poverty and mental health

Poverty is one of the leading causes of mental health issues. The uncertainty of not having a stable source of income is a substantial stressor for people. People generally work more effectively with basic needs met. They are more cooperative and have an increased ability to think creatively, which has a lot of positive results for society.

Society usually stresses the importance of contributing. Everyone should get a job. Ironically this might have the opposite of the intended effect.

### Studies on UBI

### The Stockton demonstration

The [Stockton Demonstration](https://www.stocktondemonstration.org) has shown promising results, giving increased credibility to the idea of UBI in practice.
In the demonstration, 125 randomly selected residents received a monthly paycheck of $500 for 24 months. Here are some of the key findings from the study:
1. Created a more stable income.
2. Enabled participants to find full-time work.
3. Recipients showed better all-around health, including lower levels of depression and anxiety.
4. Unconditional income genereated new possibilites for the participants to focus on starting businesses and other ventures.

### Finland: A study on UBI

[A Finish study on UBI](https://weall.org/resource/finland-universal-basic-income-pilot) ran from 2017 - 2018. It included 2000 participants, all of which were unemployed. The participants received a monthly unconditional income of around $600. The key takeaway from the study was that people reported increased well-being and less mental strain than the control group, including mild positive effects on employment, especially for families with children. In addition to this, participants reported a better outlook on the future.

This trial only included the unemployed - which is inconclusive to the general population - but the findings are still very promising. Freelancers, artists, and entrepreneurs had more positive views on the effects of basic income, which some felt had given them opportunities to start businesses.

### Hope at the end of the tunnel

Although discussion on UBI is still in the starting phases, plenty of research has shown promising results. That certainly makes the idea worthwhile to discuss and study further. You may disagree with the prepositions outlined in this document, but I invite you to consider some of the philosophies behind them. Maybe it can give you a new perspective.
