In game development we often think that object oriented is the best way.

## ECS design

An entity component system is built up of the following components:

### Entities

Entities are generic placeholders for the objects in our game world,
and can be represented by using just an id, which is what this implentation is doing.

### Components

Components are collections of data that will be connected to the entities.

### Systems

Systems are functions that will handle the components and is where the game logic itself is stored.
